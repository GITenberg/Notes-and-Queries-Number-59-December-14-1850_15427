<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST PAPER-MILL IN ENGLAND.</h3>

  <p>In the year 1588, a paper-mill was established at Dartford, in Kent,
  by John Spilman, "jeweller to the Queen." The particulars of this mill
  are recorded in a poem by Thomas Churchyard, published shortly after its
  foundation, under the following title:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A description and playne discourse of paper, and the whole benefits
  that paper brings, with rehearsall, and setting foorth in verse a
  paper-myll built near Darthforth, by an high Germaine, called Master
  Spilman, jeweller to the Queene's Majyestie."</p>

  <p>The writer says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"(Then) he that made for us a paper-mill,</p>
      <p>Is worthy well of love and worldes good will,</p>
      <p>And though his name be <i>Spill-man</i>, by degree,</p>
      <p>Yet <i>Help</i>-man now, he shall be called by mee.</p>
      <p>Six hundred men are set at work by him,</p>
      <p>That else might starve, or seeke abroade their bread;</p>
      <p>Who now live well, and go full brave and trim,</p>
      <p>And who may boast <i>they</i> are with paper fed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In another part of the poem Churchyard adds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"An high Germaine he is, as may be proovde,</p>
      <p>In Lyndoam Bodenze, borne and bred,</p>
      <p>And for this mille, may heere be truly lovde,</p>
      <p>And praysed, too, for deep device of head."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is a common idea that this was the first paper-mill erected in
  England; and we find an intelligent modern writer, Mr. J.S. Burn, in his
  <i>History of the Foreign Refugees</i>, repeating the same erroneous
  statement. At page 262, of his curious and interesting work be says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The county of Kent has been long famed for its manufacture of paper.
  It was at Dartford, in this county, that paper was <i>first made</i> in
  England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But it is proved beyond all possibility of doubt that a paper-mill
  existed in England almost a century before the date of the establishment
  at Dartford. In Henry VII.'s <i>Household Book</i>, we have the
  following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"1498. For a rewarde geven at the pulper-mylne, 16<i>s.</i>
  8<i>d.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"1499. Geven in rewarde to Tate of the Mylne, 6<i>s.</i>
  8<i>d.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And in <i>Bartholomeus de Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, printed by Wynkyn
  de Worde in 1495, mention is made of a paper-mill near Stevenage, in the
  county of Hertford, belonging to JOHN TATE the younger, which was
  undoubtedly the "mylne" visited by Henry VII.</p>

  <p>The water-mark used by John Tate was an eight-pointed star within a
  double circle. In the <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page474" id="page474"></a>{474}</span> twelfth volume of the
  <i>Archæeologia</i>, p. 114., is a variety of fac-similes of water-marks
  used by our early paper makers, exhibited in five large plates, but is
  not a little singular that the mark of John Tate is omitted.</p>

<h3>SPECIMENS OF FOREIGN ENGLISH.</h3>

  <p>The accompanying specimens of foreign English you may perhaps consider
  worth a corner among the minor curiosities of literature:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Basle.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Bains ordinaires et artificiels, tenu par B. Sigemund, Dr. in
  medicine, Basle. In this new erected establishment, which the Owner
  recommends best to all foreigners are to have,&mdash;Ordinary and artful
  baths, russia and sulphury bagnios, pumpings, artful mineral waters,
  gauze lemonads, fournished apartments for patients."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Cologne.</i> Title-page in lithograph.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<i>Remembrance on the Cathedral of Cologne.</i>&mdash;A collection of
  his most remarkable monumens, so as of the most artful ornamous and
  precious hilts of his renaconed tresory. Draconed and lithographed by
  Gerhardt Levy Elkan and Hallersch, collected by Gerhd. Emans."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Augsburg</i>, Drei Mohren Hotel. Entry in travellers' book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"January 28. 1815.&mdash;His Grace Arthur Wellesley, Duke of
  Wellington, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Great honour arrived at the beginning
  of this year to the three Moors: this illustrious warrior, whose glorious
  atchievements, which, cradled in Asia, have filled Europe with his
  renown, descended in it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Mount Etna.</i> Printed notice found attached to the wall of one of
  the rooms in the Casa degl' Inglesi, Mount Etna, October, 1844:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In consequence of the damage suffered in the house called English set
  on the Etna for the reprehensible conduct of some persons there
  recovered, the following provisional regulations are prescribed,
  authorized, and granted to M. Gemmellaro<a id="footnotetag1"
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, who has the key
  of the mentioned house for his labour, honour, and money spent to finish
  such edifice, besides his kind reception for travellers curious to visit
  the mountain.</p>

  <p>I. Any person desirous to get the key of the house is requested to
  apply to M.G., and in case of his absence, to ... signing his name,
  title, and country, in the same time tell the guide's and muleteer's
  name, just to drive away those have been so rough to spoil the moveables
  and destroy the stables ... are the men to be particularly remarked.</p>

  <p>II. Nobody is admitted without a certificate of M.G., which will
  assure to have received his name, &amp;c. &amp;c., except those are known
  by the fore-going strangers.</p>

  <p>III. According to the afore-mentioned articles, nobody will take the
  liberty to go in the house and force the lock of the door: he will really
  suffer the most severe punishment fixed against violence.</p>

  <p>IV. Is not permitted to any body to put mules in the rooms destined
  for the use of people, notwithstanding the insufficiency of stables. It
  is forbidden likewise to dirtes the walls with pencil or coal. M.G. will
  procure a blank book for those learned people curious to write their
  observations. A particular care must be taken for the moveables settled
  in the house.</p>

  <p>V. The house must be left clean and without fire, to avoid
  conflagration; it is forbidden to leave rooms or windows opened, as the
  house has been lately damaged by the winds, snow, sand, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
  the aforementioned A.D., M.N. are imputed of negligence and malice:
  persons neglecting to execute the above article will be severely
  punished, and are obliged to pay damages and expences.</p>

  <p>VI. As soon as the traveller returns at Nicolosi, either to S. Nicolo
  l'Arena, will immediately deliver the key to M.G., as it commonly happens
  that foreigners are waiting for it. A certificate must be likewise
  delivered, declaring that the afore-mentioned regulations have been
  exactly executed. It is likewise proper and just to reward M. Gem. for
  the expense of moveables, money, &amp;c, &amp;c., and for the advantage
  travellers may get to examine the Volcan, for better than Empedocli,
  Amodei, Fazelli, Brydon, Spallanzani, and great many others. M. Gemm. has
  lately been authorized to deny the key whenever is unkindly requested. He
  is also absolutely obliged to inform the gen. of the army, who is
  determined to punish with rigour their insolence."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Mount Sinai.</i>&mdash;(On the fly-leaf of the travellers'
  book.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Here in too were inscribed as in one legend, all whose in the rule of
  the year come from different parts, different cities and countries,
  pilgrims and travellers of any different rank and religion or profession,
  for advise and notice thereof to their posterity, and even also in owr
  own of memory acknowledging. 1845, Mount Sinai."</p>

  <p>The name of this gentleman will be recognised by some of the readers
  of NOTES AND QUERIES as that of a most indefatigable explorer of the
  wonders of the mountain, and the author, in the <i>Transactions of the
  Catanian Academy</i>., of excellent descriptions of its recent
  eruptions.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>May-dew.</i>&mdash;Every one has heard of the virtues of "May-dew,"
  but perhaps the complex superstition following may be less generally
  known. A respectable tradesman's wife in this town (Launceston) tells me
  that the poor people here say that a swelling in the neck may be cured by
  the patient's going <i>before sunrise</i>, on the 1st of May, to the
  grave of the last young man who has been buried in the church-yard, and
  applying the dew, gathered by passing the hand <i>three times</i> from
  the <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page475"
  id="page475"></a>{475}</span> head to the foot of the grave, to the part
  affected by the ailment.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This was told me yesterday in reply
  to a question, whether the custom of gathering "May-dew" is still
  prevailing here. I may as well add, that the common notion of improving
  the complexion by washing the face with the early dew in the fields on
  the 1st of May extensively prevails in these parts; and they say that a
  child who is weak in the back may be cured by drawing him over the grass
  wet with the morning dew. The experiment must be thrice performed, that
  is, on the mornings of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of May. I find no allusion
  to these specific applications of "May-dew" in Ellis's <i>Brand</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">H.G.T.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a id="footnote2" name="footnote2"></a><b>Footnote 2:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag2">(return)</a>
  <p>If the patient be a woman, the grave chosen must be that of the last
  young man buried, and that of the last young woman in the case of a man
  patient.</p>

</div>
  <p><i>Piskies.</i>&mdash;An old woman, the wife of a respectable farmer
  at a place called "Colmans," in the parish of Werrington, near
  Launceston, has frequently told my informant before-mentioned of a
  "piskey" (for <i>so</i>, and not <i>pixy</i>, the creature is called
  <i>here</i>, as well as in parts of Devon) which frequently <i>made its
  appearance</i> in the form of small child in the kitchen of the
  farm-house, where the inmates were accustomed to set a little stool for
  it. It would do a good deal of household work, but if the hearth and
  chimney corner were not kept neatly swept, it would pinch the maid. The
  piskey would often come into the kitchen and sit on its little stool
  before the fire, so that the old lady had many opportunities of seeing
  it. Indeed it was a familiar guest in the house for many months. At last
  it left the family under these circumstances. One evening it was sitting
  on the stool as usual, when it suddenly started, looked up, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Piskey fine, and Piskey gay,</p>
      <p>Now Piskey! run away!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and vanished; after which it never appeared again. This distich is the
  first utterance of a piskey I have heard.</p>

  <p>The word "fine" put me in mind of the expression "<i>fine</i> spirit,"
  "<i>fine</i> Ariel," &amp;c., noticed by DR. KENNEDY lately in NOTES AND
  QUERIES (Vol. ii., p. 251.). It is worth notice that the people here seem
  to entertain no doubt as to the identity of piskies and fairies. Indeed I
  am told, that the old woman before mentioned called her guest
  indifferently "piskey" or "fairy."</p>

  <p>The country people in this neighbourhood sometimes put a prayer-book
  under a child's pillow as a charm to keep away the piskies. I am told
  that a poor woman near Launceston was fully persuaded that one of her
  children was taken away and a piskey substituted, the disaster being
  caused by the absence of the prayer-book on one particular night. This
  story reminds me of the "killcrop."</p>

  <p class="author">H.G.T.</p>

  <p>1. The <i>dun cow</i> of Dunsmore filled with milk every vessel that
  was brought to her till an envious witch tried to milk her in a

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

  <p><i>Circulation of the Blood.</i>&mdash;About twenty-five years since,
  being in a public library in France, a learned physician pointed out to
  me in the works of the Venerable Bede a passage in which the fact of the
  circulation of the blood appeared to him and myself to be clearly stated.
  I regret that I did not, at the time, "make a note of it," and that I
  cannot now refer to it, not having access to a copy of Bede: and I now
  mention it in hopes that some of your correspondents may think it worth
  while to make it a subject of research.</p>

  <p><i>Culprit, Origin of the Word.</i>&mdash;Long ago I made this note,
  that this much used English word was of French extraction, and that it
  was "<i>qu'il paruit</i>," from the short way the clerk of the court has
  of pronouncing his words; for our pleadings were formerly in French, and
  when the pleadings were begun, he said to the defendant "<i>qu'il
  parait</i>"&mdash;culprit; and as he was generally culpable, the
  "<i>qu'il parait</i>" became a synonyme with offender.</p>

  <p><i>Collar of SS.</i>&mdash;In the volume of Bury Wills just issued by
  the Camden Society, is an engraving from the decorations of the chantry
  chapel in St. Mary's Church, Bury St. Edmund's, of John Baret, who died
  in 146-; in which the collar is represented as SS in the upright form set
  on a collar of leather or other material. It is described in the will as
  "my collar of the king's livery." John Baret, says the editor of the
  Wills, was a lay officer of the monastery of St. Edmund, probably
  treasurer, and was deputed to attend Henry VI. on the occasion of the
  king's long visit to that famed monastic establishment in 14&mdash;.</p>

  <p><i>The Singing of Swans.</i>&mdash;"It would," says Bishop Percy

  groundless a notion as the singing of swans," <!-- Page 476 --><span

  <p><i>Portraits of Stevens and Cotton and Bunyan.</i>&mdash;The plan of
  "NOTES AND QUERIES" appears well adapted to record the change of hands
  into which portraits of literary men may pass. I accordingly offer two to
  your notice.</p>

  <p>The portrait of George Stevens, the celebrated annotator on
  Shakspeare, who died in 1800, was bequeathed by him to a relative, Mrs.
  Gomm of Spital Square; and at that lady's death, some years after, it
  passed, I have reason to expect, into the possession of her relative, Mr.
  Fince, of Bishopsgate Street. I have no farther information of it.</p>

  <p>The portrait of Charles Cotton, by Sir Peter Lely, was, at the time
  (1814) when Linnell took a copy, and (in 1836) when Humphreys took a
  copy, in the possession of John Berisford, Esq., of Compton House,
  Ashborne, Derbyshire; and the following extracts of letters will show who
  at present possesses it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Leek, 14th July, 1842.</p>

  <p>"After Mr. Berisford's decease, I should think the portrait of Cotton
  would fall into the hands of his nephew Francis Wright, Esq., of Linton
  Hall, near Nottingham.</p>

  <p>3. In the "Life of Robin Hood" prefixed to Ritson's <i>Collection of
  Ballads concerning Robin Hood</i> (People's edit. p. 27.), the following
  story, extracted from <i>Certaine Merry Tales of the Madmen of
  Gottam</i>, by Dr. Andrew Borde, an eminent physician, temp. Hen. VIII.
  (Black letter), in Bodleian Library, occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"There was two men of <i>_Gottam</i>, and the one of them was going to
  the market to Nottingham to buy sheepe, and the other came from the
  market; and both met together upon Nottingham bridge. Well met, said the
  one to the other. Whither be yee going? said he that came from
  Nottingham. Marry, said he that was going thither, I goe to the market to
  buy sheepe. Buy sheepe? said the other, and which way wilt thou bring
  them home? Marry, said the other, I will bring them over this bridge. By
  Robin Hood, said he that came from Nottingham, but thou shalt not. By
  Maid Marrion, said he that was going thitherward, but I will. Thou shalt
  not, said the one. I will, said the other. Ter here! said the one. Shue
  there! said the other. Then they beat their staves against the ground,
  one against the other, as there had been an hundred sheepe betwixt them.
  Hold in, said the one. Beware the leaping over the bridge of any sheepe,
  said the other. I care not, said the other. They shall not come this way,
  said the one. But they shall, said the other. Then said the other, and if
  that thou make much to doe, I will put my finger in thy mouth. A t..d
  thou wilt, said the other. And as they were at their contention, another
  man of <i>Gottam</i> came from the market with a sack of meale upon a
  horse, and seeing and hearing his neighbours at strife for sheepe, and
  none betwixt them, said, Ah, fooles, will you never learn wit? Helpe me,
  said he that had the meale, and lay my sacke upon my shoulder. They did
  so and he went to the one side of the bridge, and unloosed the mouth of
  the sacke, and did shake out all his meale into the river. Now,
  neighbours, said the mall, how much meale is there in my sacke now?
  Marry, there is none at all, said they. Now, by my faith, said he, even
  as much wit as in your two heads, to strive for that thing you have not.
  Which was the wisest of all these three persons, judge you?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>4. Tom Coryat, in an oration to the Duke of York (afterwards Chas.
  I.), called <i>Crambe, or Colwarts twice sodden</i> (London, 1611), has
  this passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I came to Venice, and quickly took a survey of the whole model of the
  city, together with the most remarkable matters thereof; and shortly
  after any arrival in England I overcame any adversaries in the Town of
  Evill, in my native county of Somersetshire, who thought to have sunk me
  in a bargain of pilchards, as the <i>wise men of Gottam</i> went about to
  drown an eel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>5. Dr. More's <i>Antidote against Atheism</i>, cap. ii. § 14.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"But because so many bullets joggled together in a man's hat will
  settle a determinate figure, or because the frost and wind will draw upon
  doors and glass windows pretty uncouth streaks like feathers and other
  fooleries which are to no use or purpose, try infer thence, that all the
  contrivances that are in nature, even the frame of the bodies, both of
  men and beasts, are from no other principle but the jumbling together of
  the matter, and so because that this doth naturally effect something,
  that is the cause of all things, seems to me to be reasoning in the same
  mood and figure with that wise market man's, who, going down a hill and
  carrying his cheeses under his arms, one of them falling and trundling
  down the hill very fast, let the other go after it appointing them all to
  meet him at his house at <i>Gotham</i>, not doubting but they beginning
  so hopefully, would be able to make good the whole journey; or like
  another of the same town, who perceiving that his iron trevet he had
  bought had three feet, and could stand, expected also that it should walk
  too, and save him the labour of the carriage."</p>

<h3>HERSTMONCEUX CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>Can you find an early place in your pages for the following Queries
  relative to the history of Herstmonceux Castle and its lords, on which a
  memoir is in preparation for the next volume of the collections of the
  Sussex Archæological Society.</p>

  <p>1. Who was Pharamuse of Boulogne, father of Sybil de Tingry? He is
  called the <i>nephew</i> of Maud, King Stephen's wife; but I believe
  there is no doubt that she was the only child and sole heir of Eustace
  Earl of Boulogne, brother of Godfrey, King of Jerusalem. Where is
  <i>Tingry</i>, of which place he was lord? Is there any place in the
  North of France bearing that name now?</p>

  <p>2. Will any one well skilled in the interpretation of ancient legal
  documents furnish some explanation of the following extracts from the
  <i>Rotul. de Fin.</i> (Hardy, i. 19.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"1199. William de Warburton and Ingelram de Monceux give 500 marks to
  the king for having the inheritance of Juliana, wife of William, son of
  Aymer, whose next of kin they say they are."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Yet six years later, 1205 (Hardy, i. 310 )&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Waleran de Monceux gives 100 marks for having the reasonable
  (rationabilis) part of the inheritance of Juliana, as regards (versus)
  Wm. de Warburton, William and Waleran being her next of kin."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This Waleran was son of Idonea <i>de Herst</i> (now Herst Monceux),
  and appears in other documents as "Waleran <i>de Herst</i>." The land in
  question was in <i>Compton</i> (afterwards Compton <i>Monceux</i>),
  Hants.</p>

  <p>Now how are we to reconcile the two above-quoted documents? What was
  the connexion <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page478"
  id="page478"></a>{478}</span> between Ingelram and Waleran? And how is
  Waleran's double appellation to be explained? I see a reference to a
  family named <i>de Mounceaux</i> in the last number of the
  <i>Archæological Journal</i>, p. 300., holding a manor near Hawbridge,
  Somerset Were they of the same stock?</p>

  <p>3. The magnificent monument in Herstmonceux church to Thomas Lord
  Dacre (who died 1534), and his eldest son, is embellished with a
  considerable number of coats of arms, several of which I am unable to
  identity with any connexions of the family. These are,&mdash;(1.) Sable,
  a cross or; (2.) Barry of six, ar. and az., a bend gules; (3.) Arg. a
  fesse gules; (4.) Quarterly or, and gules, an escarbuncle sable; (5.)
  Barry of six, arg. and gules; (6.) Azure, an orle of martlets or, on an
  inescutcheon arg. three bass gules.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers, acquainted with the Dacre and Fienes
  pedigrees, appropriate any of these coats?</p>

  <p>4. A suite of small bed-rooms, and the gallery from which they opened,
  in Herstmonceux Castle, were called respectively the <i>Bethlem
  Chambers</i> and <i>Bethlem Gallery</i>: is any instance of a similar
  denomination of apartments known, and can the reason be assigned?</p>

  <p>5. Sir Roger Fienes, the builder of Herstmonceux Castle, accompanied
  Henry V. to Agincourt. Are any references to him to be found in Sir H.
  Nicolas' <i>Battle of Azincourt</i>, or elsewhere?</p>

  <p>6. Francis Lord Dacre was one of the noble twelve who had the courage
  to appear in their places in the House of Lords and reject the ordinance
  for the trial of Charles I. His son Thomas, who married the daughter of
  Charles II. by the Duchess of Cleveland, and was created Earl of Sussex,
  was compelled through his extravagance to alienate the castle and manor
  of Herstmonceux. Are there any references to either of these peers, who
  played a not inconspicuous part in the events of their times, in any of
  the contemporary memoirs? Any information on any of the above points
  would greatly oblige</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES</h3>.

  <p><i>Yorkshire Ballads.</i>&mdash;Any of your readers would confer a
  great favour by referring me to any early Yorkshire ballads, or ballads
  relating to places in Yorkshire, not reprinted in the ordinary
  collections, such as Percy, Evans, &amp;c. I am of course acquainted with
  those in the Roxburghe collection.</p>

  <p class="author">H.</p>

  <p><i>Ringing a Handbell before a Corpse.</i>&mdash;Is it true that
  whenever an interment takes place in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, the
  corpse is preceded on its way to the grave by a person who rings a small
  handbell at intervals, each time giving a few tinkling strokes? My
  informant on this subject was an Oxford undergraduate, who said that he
  had recently witnessed the burials both of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a late
  student of Christ Church, and of Miss &mdash;&mdash;, daughter of a
  living bishop: and he assured me that in both cases this ceremony was
  observed. Certainly it is possible to go through the academical course at
  Oxford without either hearing the bell, or knowing of its use on such
  occasions: but I should now be glad to receive some explanation of this
  singular custom.</p>

  <p>Ecclesfield.</p>

  <p><i>Church of St. Saviour, Canterbury.</i>&mdash;Tradition, I believe,
  has uniformly represented that an edifice more ancient, but upon the
  present site of St. Martin's, Canterbury, was used by St. Augustine and
  his followers in the earliest age of Christianity in this country. St.
  Martin's has, on that account, been often spoken of as the mother-church
  of England. Lately, however, in perusing the fourth volume of Mr.
  Kemble's <i>Codex Diplomaticus</i>, p. 1. I find a charter of King
  Canute, of the year 1018, which states the church of ST. SAVIOUR,
  <i>Canterbury</i>, to be the mother-church of England:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Æcclesia Salvatoris in Dorobernia sita, omnium Æcclesiarum regni
  Angligeni <i>mater et domina</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In none of the histories of Kent or of Canterbury can I find any
  mention of a church dedicated to St. Saviour. May I beg the favour of you
  to insert this among your Notes?</p>

  <p><i>Mock Beggar's Hall.</i>&mdash;What is the origin of this name as

  and another near Ipswich, in Suffolk. And what is the earliest instance
  of the title?</p>

  <p class="author">BURIENSIS.</p>

  <p><i>Beatrix Lady Talbot.</i>&mdash;Since the publication of Sir Harris
  Nicolas' able contribution to the <i>Collectanea Topographica et
  Genealogica</i> (vol. i. pp. 80-90.) no one may be excused for
  confounding, as Dugdale and his followers had done, Beatrix Lady Talbot
  with Donna Beatrix, daughter of John, King of Portugal, to whom Thomas
  FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, was married, 26th Nov., 1405. What I now wish
  to learn is, whether anything has since been discovered to elucidate
  further the pedigree of Lady Talbot? It is evident that she was of
  Portuguese origin; and it may be inferred from the quarterings on her
  seal, as shown in a manuscript in the British Museum (1st and 4th arg.,
  five escutcheons in cross az., each charged with five plates in saltire,
  for <i>Portugal</i>; and 2nd and 3rd az., five crescents in saltire, or),
  that she was a member of the Portuguese family of Pinto, which is the
  only house in Portugal that bears the five crescents in saltire, as
  displayed on the seal.</p>

  of the Inquisition which he intended to publish; and in a batch of
  advertisements preceding the first volume of Smedley's <i>Reformed
  Religion in France</i>, published in 1832 by Rivingtons, as part of their
  Theological Library. I find an announcement of other works to be included
  in the series, and amongst others, already in preparation, <i>The Origin
  and Growth of the Roman Catholic Inquisition against Heresy and
  Apostacy</i>; by Joseph Blanco White, M.A. I need not ask whether the
  work was <i>published</i>, for it is not to be found in the London
  Catalogue; but I wish to ask whether any portion of the work was ever
  placed in the publisher's hands, or ever printed; or whether he made any
  considerable progress in the collection, and, if so, in whose hands the
  MSS. are? Such papers, if they exist, would probably prove of too much
  importance to allow of their remaining unpublished.</p>

  is the proper lining of the scarlet cloth hoods worn by doctors in the
  three faculties of the university of Cambridge? The robe-makers of
  Cambridge have determined upon a pink or rose-coloured silk for all; the
  London artists adopt a shot silk (light blue and crimson) sometimes for
  all faculties, at others for Doctors in Divinity only. On ancient
  monuments (there is one in Canterbury Cathedral) I find that the hoods
  were lined with ermine; and this is the material of those attached to the
  full-dress robes of doctors on the occasion of their creation, and in the
  schools, and at congregations. I cannot find the statutes bearing upon
  the subject.</p>

  <p>As the Oxford statutes have recently been published, the matter is not
  so much in the dark,&mdash;black silk being the material prescribed for
  the lining of hoods of Doctors in Divinity, and those of the doctors in
  the other faculties being prescribed to be of <i>silk of any intermediate
  colour</i>, which the Oxford doctors understand to mean a deep
  rose-colour.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>CHURCH HISTORY SOCIETY.</h3>

  <p>I am much obliged to your correspondent LAICUS for his inquiry
  respecting the proposed Society (Vol. ii., p. 464). Will you allow me to
  express to him my confident hope, that the proposed plan, or some
  modification of it by a committee (when one shall exist) may in due time
  be carried out. But there seems to be no reason for haste; and in the
  formation of such body it is desirable to have as many avowed supporters
  to select from as possible. I do not think that the matter is much known
  yet, though I have to thank you for a kind notice; and I need not tell
  some of your correspondents that I have received very encouraging
  letters. But, in truth, as I did not expect any profit, or desire any
  responsibility as to either money or management, and only wished to lay
  before the public an idea which had existed in my own mind for some
  years, and which had obtained the sanction of some whom I thought
  competent judges; and as I had, moreover, published pamphlets enough to
  know that a contribution of waste paper to any object is often one of the
  most costly, I did not feel myself called on to go to so much expense in
  advertising as I perhaps might have done if I had been spending the money
  of a society instead of my own. I sent but few copies; none, I believe,
  except to persons with whom I had some acquaintance, and whom I thought
  likely to take more or less interest in the subject.</p>

  <p>I trust, however, that the matter is quietly and solidly growing; and
  from communications which I have received, and resources on which I
  believe I may reckon, I feel no doubt that if it were considered
  desirable, friends and money enough to set such a society going might be
  immediately brought forward. It is one advantage of the proposed plan,
  that it may be tried on almost any scale. A society so constituted would
  NOT begin its existence <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page481" id="page481"></a>{481}</span> with great promises of
  returns to subscribers, and heavy engagements to printers, papermakers,
  and editors. Its only <i>necessary</i> expenses would be those of
  <i>management</i>; and if the society were very small, these expenses
  would be so too. It is, indeed, hardly possible to imagine that they
  should be such as not to leave something to be funded for future use, if
  they did not furnish means for immediate display; but it seems better to
  wait patiently until such real substantial support is guaranteed as may
  prevent all apprehension on that score.</p>

<h3>DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 442.)</p>

  <p>It is quite startling to be told that the title of "Defender of the
  Faith" was used by any royal predecessor of Henry VIII.</p>

  <p>Selden (<i>Titles of Honour</i>, ed 1631, p. 54) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The beginning and ground of that attribute of DEFENDER OF THE FAITH,
  which hath been perpetually, in the later ages, added to the style of the
  kings of England, (not only in the first person, but frequent also in the
  second and in the third, as common use shows in the formality of
  instruments of conveyance, leases and such like) is most certainly known.
  It began in Henry the VIII. For he, in those awaking times, upon the
  quarrel of the Romanists and Lutherans, wrote a volume against Luther,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Selden then states the well-known occasion upon which this title was
  conferred, and sets out the Bull of Leo X. (then extant in the Collection
  of Sir Robert Cotton, and now in the British Museum), whereby the Pope,
  "holding it just to distinguish those who have undertaken such pious
  labours for defending the faith of Christ with every honour and
  commendation," decrees that to the title of King the subjects of the
  royal controversialist shall add the title "Fidei Defensori." The pontiff
  adds, that a more worthy title could not be found.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent, COLONEL ANSTRUTHER, calls attention to the
  statement made by Mr. Christopher Wren, Secretary of the Order of the
  Garter (A.D. 1736), in his letter to Francis Peck, on the authority of
  the Register of the Order in his possession; which letter is quoted by
  Burke (<i>Dorm. and Ext. Bar.</i>, iv. 408.), that "King Henry VII. had
  the title Defender of the Faith." It is not found in any acts or
  instruments of his reign that I am acquainted with, nor in the
  proclamation on his interment, nor in any of the epitaphs engraved on his
  magnificent tomb. (Sandford, <i>Geneal. Hist.</i>) Nor is it probable
  that Pope Leo X., in those days of diplomatic intercourse with England,
  would have bestowed on Henry VIII., as a special and personal distinction
  and reward, a title that had been used by his royal predecessors.</p>

  <p>I am not aware that any such title is attributed to the sovereign in
  any of the English records anterior to 1521; but that many English kings
  gloried in professing their zeal to defend the Church and religion,
  appears from many examples. Henry IV., in the second year of his reign,
  promises to maintain and defend the Christian religion (<i>Rot.
  Parl.</i>, iii. 466.); and on his renewed promise, in the fourth year of
  his reign, to defend the Christian faith, the Commons piously grant a
  subsidy (<i>Ibid.</i>, 493.); and Henry VI., in the twentieth year of his
  reign, acts as keeper of the Christian faith. (<i>Rot. Parl.</i>, v.
  61.)</p>

  <p>In the admonition used in the investiture of a knight with the
  insignia of the Garter, he is told to take the crimson robe, and being
  therewith defended, to be bold to fight and shed his blood for Christ's
  faith, the liberties of the Church, and the defence of the oppressed. In
  this sense, the sovereign and every knight became a sworn defender of the
  faith. Can this duty have come to be popularly attributed as part of the
  royal style and title?</p>

  <p>The Bull of Leo X., which confers the title on Henry VIII. personally,
  does not make it inheritable by his successors, so that none but that
  king himself could claim the honour. The Bull granted two years
  afterwards by Clement VII. merely confirms the grant of Pope Leo to the
  king himself. It was given, as we know, for his assertion of doctrines of
  the Church of Rome; yet he retained it after his separation from the
  Roman Catholic communion, and after it had been formally revoked and
  withdrawn by Pope Paul III. in the twenty-seventh year of Henry VIII.,
  upon the king's apostacy in turning suppressor of religious houses. In
  1543, the Reformation legislature and the Anti-papal king, without
  condescending to notice any Papal Bulls, assumed to treat the title that
  the Pope had given and taken away as a subject of Parliamentary gift, and
  annexed it for ever to the English crown by the statute 35 Hen. VIII. c.
  3., from which I make the following extract, as its language bears upon
  the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Where our most dread, &amp;c., lord the king, hath heretofore been,
  and is justly, lawfully, and notoriously knowen, named, published, and
  declared to be King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the
  Faith, and the Church of England and also of Ireland, in earth supreme
  head; and hath justly and lawfully used the title and name thereof as to
  his Grace appertaineth. Be it enacted, &amp;c., that all and singular his
  Graces' subject, &amp;c., shall from henceforth accept and take the same
  his Majesty's style ... viz., in the English tongue by these words, Henry
  the Eighth, by the grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland,
  Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England, and also of Ireland,
  in earth the supreme head; and that the said style, &amp;c., shall be,
  &amp;c., united <!-- Page 482 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page482"
  id="page482"></a>{482}</span> and annexed for ever to the imperial crown
  of his highness's realms of England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By the supposed authority of this statute, and notwithstanding the
  revocation of the title by Pope Paul III., and its omission in the Bull
  addressed by Pope Julius III. to Philip and Mary, that princess, before
  and after her marriage, used this style, and the statute having, been
  re-established by 1 Eliz. c. 1., the example has been followed by her
  royal Protestant successors, who wished thereby to declare themselves
  Defenders of the Anti-papal Church. The learned Bishop Gibson, in his
  <i>Codex</i> (i. 33, note), treats this title as having commenced in
  Henry VIII. So do Blount, Cowel, and such like authorities.</p>

  <p class="author">WM. SIDNEY GIBSON.</p>

  <p>Newcastle-on-Tyne, Dec. 1850.</p>

  <p>P.S. Since writing the above, I have found (in the nineteenth volume
  of <i>Archæologia</i>, pp. 1-10.) an essay by Mr. Alex. Luders on this
  very subject, in which that able writer, who was well accustomed to
  examine historical records, refers to many examples in which the title
  "Most Christian King" was attributed to, or used by English sovereigns,
  as well as the kings of France; and to the fact, that this style was used
  by Henry VII., as appears from his contract with the Abbot of Westminster
  (Harl. MS. 1498.). Selden tells us that the emperors had from early times
  been styled "Defensores Ecclesiæ;" and from the instances cited by Mr.
  Luders, it appears that the title of "Most Christian" was appropriated to
  kings of France from a very ancient period; that Pepin received it (A.D.
  755) from the Pope, and Charles the Bald (A.D. 859) from a Council: and
  Charles VI. refers to ancient usage for this title, and makes use of
  these words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"&mdash;nostrorum progenitorum imitatione&mdash;evangelicæ
  veritatis&mdash;DEFENSORES&mdash;nostra regia dignitas divino Christianæ
  religionis titulo gloriosius insignitur&mdash;."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Luders refers to the use of the words "Nos zelo <i>fidei
  catholicæ</i>, cujus sumus et erimus Deo dante <i>Defensores</i>,
  salubriter commoti" in the charter of Richard II. to the Chancellor of
  Oxford, in the nineteenth year of his reign, as the earliest introduction
  of such phrases into acts of the kings of England that he had met with.
  This zeal was for the condemnation of Wycliff's <i>Trialogus</i>. In the
  reign of Hen. IV. the writ "De Hæretico comburendo" had the words
  "Zelator justitia et fidei catholicæ cultor;" and the title of "Très
  Chrêtien" occurs in several instruments of Hen. VI. and Edw. IV. It
  appears very probable that this usage was the foundation of the statement
  made by Chamberlayne and by Mr. Christopher Wren: but that the title of
  Defender of the Faith was used as part of the royal style before 1521,
  is, I believe, quite untrue.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF JEZEBEL.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 357.)</p>

  <p>There appear to be two serious objections to the idea of your
  correspondent W.G.H. respecting the appearance of <i>Baal</i> in this
  word: 1. The original orthography (<span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5BC;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>);
  whereas the name of the deity is found on all Ph&#339;nician monuments,
  where it enters largely into the composition of proper names, written
  <span lang="he" title="b`l" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5E2;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>: and, 2. The fact of female
  names being generally on these same monuments (as tombstones and so
  forth) compounded of the name of a <i>goddess</i>, specially Astarth
  (<span lang="he" title="'atiorit" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B7;&#x5EA;&#x5BC;&#x5B4;&#x5B9;&#x5E8;&#x5B4;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>
  or <span lang="he" title="`a" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5B7;</bdo></span>). I do not know that we have any
  example of a female name into which <i>Baal</i> enters.</p>

  <p>The derivation of the word appears to be that given by Gesenius
  (s.v.); that it is compounded of the root <span lang="he" title="zabal"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5B8;&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  (habitavit, cohabitavit) and the negative <span lang="he" title="'eiyn"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B5;&#x5D9;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, and that its
  meaning is the same as <span lang="el" title="alochos"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, casta: comp.
  <i>Agnes</i>. <i>Isabel</i>, in fact, would be a name nearer the original
  than the form in which we have it.</p>

  <p class="author">SC.</p>

  <p>Carmarthen, Oct. 29. 1850.</p>

  <p><i>Jezebel.</i>&mdash;W.G.H. has been misled by the ending <i>bel</i>.
  The Ph&#339;nician god <i>Bel</i> or <i>Baal</i> has nothing to do with
  this name,&mdash;the component words being <i>Je-zebel</i>, not
  <i>Jeze-bel</i>. Of the various explanations given, that of Gesenius
  (<i>Heb. Lex.</i>, s. voc.) appears, as usual, the simplest and most
  rational. The name <span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  (Jezebel) he derives from <span lang="he" title="'iy" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;</bdo></span> (<i>i</i>) "not" (comp.
  I-chabod, "In-glorious") and <span lang="he" title="zabal" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5B8;&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> (zábal), "to
  dwell, cohabit with."</p>

  <p>The name will then mean "without cohabitation," <i>i.e.</i> <span
  lang="el" title="alochos"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> (Plat. <i>Theæt.</i>)
  "chaste, modest." Comp. <i>Agnes</i>, <i>Katherine</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Less satisfactory explanations may be found in Calmet's
  <i>Dictionary</i>, and the <i>Cyclopædia of Biblical Literature</i>,
  edited by Dr. Kitlo.</p>

  <p class="author">R.T.H.G.</p>

  <p><i>Jezebel.</i>&mdash;The Hebrew spelling <span lang="he"
  title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  presents so much difficulty, that I fear such a derivation as W.G.H.
  wishes to obtain for the name is not practicable by any known etymology.
  Nothing that I am aware of, either in Hebrew, Syriac, or Arabic, will
  help us. The nearest verb that I can find is the Chaldee <span lang="he"
  title="'aza'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B2;&#x5D6;&#x5B8;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, signifying,
  "to light a fire," parts of which occur two or three times in Dan. iii.;
  but I fear it would be too daring a conjecture to interpret the name
  <i>quem Belus accendit</i> on the strength of that verb's existence. At
  present I feel myself obliged to take the advice of Winer, in his
  <i>Lexicon</i>, "Satius est ignorantiam fateri quam argutari."</p>

  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> (Lord) makes a
  component part of many Syrian names is well-known: but I do not think the
  contracted form <span lang="he" title="beil" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B5;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, which was used by the
  Babylonians, is ever found in any Syrian names. If we suppose the name
  <span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  to be derived from <span lang="he" title="beil" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B5;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> or <span lang="he"
  title="ba`al" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, we must find
  a meaning for the previous letters. Gesenius derives the name from <span
  lang="he" title="'y" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>, the
  negative particle, <span lang="he" title="zbl" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5D1;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, and gives it the sense of
  "innuba", <i>i.e.</i> "pure," comparing it, as a female name, with the
  Christian Agnes. There is but one passage, however, in Scripture which
  supports this secondary sense of <span lang="he" title="zbl" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5D1;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> properly, "to be round," or,
  "to make round," and then "to dwell;" from whence <span lang="he"
  title="zbwl" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, "a
  dwelling or habitation:" also <span lang="he" title="zbwlwn" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>,
  "dwellings," the name which Leah gives to her sixth son, because she
  hopes that thenceforward her husband <span lang="he" title="yizbleiwiy"
  ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5D6;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5B0;&#x5DC;&#x5B5;&#x5D5;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>,
  "will dwell with me." (Gen. xxx. 20.) Gesenius considers this equivalent
  with "cohabit;" and from this single passage draws the sense which he
  assigns to <span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  This seems rather far-fetched. I am, however, still inclined to give the
  sense of "pure, unpolluted," to <span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>,
  but on different grounds.</p>

  <p><span lang="he" title="zebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> has another
  sense, <span lang="el" title="kopros"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, particularly of
  camels, from the round form; and the word was common, in the later
  Hebrew, in that sense. Hence the evil spirit is called <span lang="he"
  title="ba`al-zbwl" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;&#x5BE;&#x5D6;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>,
  a contemptuous name, instead of <span lang="he" title="ba`al-zbwb" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;&#x5BE;&#x5D6;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>
  = <span lang="el" title="Beelzeboul"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B6;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;</span>
  instead of <span lang="el" title="Beelzeboub"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B6;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;</span>
  (Matt. xii. 24.).</p>

  <p>The negative of this word <span lang="he" title="'iyzebel" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>

  undefiled," <span lang="el" title="Amiautos"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and
  this conjecture is supported by comparing 2 Kings, ix. 37. with the same
  verse in the <i>Targum</i> of Jonathan. They are as follows: (Heb.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span lang="he" title="wihayta niblat 'iyzebel krmen `al-pneiy hasreh" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5B4;&#x5D4;&#x5B8;&#x5D9;&#x5B0;&#x5EA;&#x5B8; &#x5E0;&#x5B4;&#x5D1;&#x5B0;&#x5DC;&#x5B7;&#x5EA; &#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC; &#x5DB;&#x5BC;&#x5B0;&#x5E8;&#x5DE;&#x5B6;&#x5DF; &#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC;&#x5BE;&#x5E4;&#x5B0;&#x5E0;&#x5B5;&#x5D9; &#x5D4;&#x5B7;&#x5E9;&#x5C2;&#x5E8;&#x5B6;&#x5D4;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the <i>Targum</i> thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p><span lang="he" title="wtiheiy nibeiylta' r'iyzebel kzebel mbarar `al 'apeiy taqla':" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5BC;&#x5EA;&#x5B4;&#x5D4;&#x5B5;&#x5D9; &#x5E0;&#x5B4;&#x5D1;&#x5B5;&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5EA;&#x5BC;&#x5B8;&#x5D0; &#x5E8;&#x5B0;&#x5D0;&#x5B4;&#x5D9;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC; &#x5DB;&#x5BC;&#x5B0;&#x5D6;&#x5B6;&#x5D1;&#x5B6;&#x5DC; &#x5DE;&#x5B0;&#x5D1;&#x5B7;&#x5E8;&#x5BC;&#x5B7;&#x5E8; &#x5E2;&#x5B7;&#x5DC; &#x5D0;&#x5B7;&#x5E4;&#x5BC;&#x5B5;&#x5D9; &#x5EA;&#x5B7;&#x5E7;&#x5B0;&#x5DC;&#x5B8;&#x5D0;&#x5C3;</bdo></span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is quite clear that the Targumists intended here a strong allusion
  to the <i>original</i> meaning of Jezebel's name; viz. that she who was
  named "the undefiled" should become as "defilement." I am not sure
  whether a disquisition of this kind may be considered irrelevant to your
  work; but as the idea seems not an improbable one to some whose judgment
  I value, I venture to send it.</p>

<h3>SOCINIAN BOAST.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. ii., p. 375.).</p>

  <p>One of your correspondents, referring to the lines lately quoted by
  Dr. Pusey&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Tota jacet Babylon; destruxit tecta Lutherus,</p>
      <p>Calvinus muros, sed fundamenta Socinus."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>inquires "by what Socinian writer" are these two hexameter verses used
  ?</p>

  <p>In reply, I beg to remark that by "Socinian" is, I suppose, meant
  "Unitarian," for even the immediate converts of Socinus refused to be
  called Socinians, alleging that their belief was founded on the teaching
  of Jesus Christ; and modern Unitarians, disowning all human authority in
  religious matters, cannot take to themselves the name of Socinus.</p>

  <p>The distich, however, appears to have been in use among the Polish
  Unitarians shortly after the death of Faustus Socinus, as respectfully
  expressive of the exact effect which they conceived that he had produced
  in the religious world. Mr. Wallace, in his <i>Antitrinitarian
  Biography</i>, vol. iii. p. 323., states that it is "the epitaph said to
  have been inscribed on the tomb of Faustus Socinus." Mr. Wallace's
  authority for this assertion I have not been able to discover. Bock
  (<i>Hist. Antitrinitariorum</i>, vol. iii. p. 725.), whom Mr. Wallace
  generally follows, observes that the adherents of Faustus Socinus were
  accustomed to use these lines "respecting his decease," (qui de ejus
  obitu canere soliti sunt). This would seem to imply that the lines were
  composed not long after the death of Faustus Socinus. Probably they
  formed originally a part of poem written as a eulogy on him by some
  minister of the Unitarian church. The case would not be without a
  parallel.</p>

  <p>Three versions of the distich are before me; that cited by Dr. Pusey,
  and the two which follow:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Alta ruit Babylon; destruxit tecta Lutherus,</p>
      <p>Muros Calvinus, sed fundamenta Socinus."</p>
      <p class="i16">Fock, <i>Socinianismus</i>, vol. i. p. 180.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Tota ruet Babylon; destruxit tecta Lutherus,</p>
      <p>Muros Calvinus, sed fundamenta Socinus."</p>
      <p class="i16">Bock, <i>ut supra</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Which is the original? Bock's reading has the preference in my mind,
  because he is known to have founded his history on the results of his own
  personal investigations among the manuscripts as <!-- Page 484 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>{484}</span> well as
  the printed documents of the Polish Unitarian Churches. Besides, if, as
  there is reason to believe, the lines were composed shortly after the
  death of F. Socinus, <i>ruet</i> (<i>will</i> fall) would now correctly
  describe what, at so small a distance from the days of Luther and Calvin,
  may be supposed to have been the feeling among the Polish Unitarians;
  whereas Dr. Pusey's <i>jacet</i> (lies low, in the <i>present</i> tense)
  does as certainly partake somewhat of the grandiloquent. That no "boast,"
  however, was intended, becomes probable, when we consider that the
  distich was designed to convey a feeling of reverence towards Socinus
  rather than an insult to Rome.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>The Königs-stuhl at Rheuze</i> (Vol. ii., p. 442.).&mdash;DR. BELL,
  who inquires for an engraving of the old <i>Königs</i> or
  <i>Kaisers-stuhl</i>, at Rheuze, is referrred to the <i>History of
  Germany, on the Plan of Mrs. Markham's Histories</i>, published by
  Murray, where, on the 188th page, he will find a very neat woodcut of
  this building, which we are told was destroyed in 1807, and rebuilt after
  the original model in 1843. It is of an octagon form, supported by
  pillars, with seven stone seats round the sides for the electors, and one
  in the centre for the emperor.</p>

  <p class="author">M.H.G.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The woodcuts of this work deserve especial commendation, being
  accurate representations of objects of historical interest, instead of
  the imaginative illustrations too often introduced into works which claim
  to represent the truth of history. Many of the engravings, such as that
  of the <i>room in which the Council of Constance was held</i>, and the
  <i>Cages of the Anabaptists</i> attached to the tower of <i>St. Lambert's
  Church, Munster</i>, are, we have understood, copied from original
  sketches placed at Mr. Murray's disposal for the purpose of being used in
  the work in question.]</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. Tempest</i> (Vol. ii., p. 407.).&mdash;This lady was one of
  the two daughters of Henry Tempest, Esq., of Newton Grange, Yorkshire
  (son of Sir John Tempest of Tong Hall, who was created a baronet in
  1664), by his wife Alathea, daughter of Sir Henry Thompson of Marston,
  co. York. She died unmarried in 1703. As the Daphne of Pope's pastoral
  "Winter," inscribed to her memory, she is celebrated in terms which
  scarcely bear out the remark of your correspondent, that the poet "has no
  special allusion to her."</p>

  <p class="author">J.T. HAMMACK.</p>

  <p><i>Calendar of Sundays in Greek and Romish Churches.</i>&mdash;In
  reply to M.'s Query, I beg to inform him, that to find a calendar of
  <i>both</i> the above churches, he need seek no further than the
  <i>Almanach de Gotha</i> for the year 1851. He will there find what he
  wants, on authority no doubt sufficient.</p>

  <p class="author">D.C.</p>

  <p><i>The Conquest</i> (Vol. ii., p. 440).&mdash;I do not agree with L.
  in thinking that the modern notion, that this word means "a forcible
  method of acquisition," is an erroneous one; but have no doubt that,
  whatever its original derivation may be, it was used in that sense. If
  William I. never pretended "to annex the idea of victory to
  conquisition," it is certain that his son William II. did: for we find a
  charter of his in the <i>Monasticon</i> (ed. 1846), vol. vi. p. 992.,
  confirming a grant of the church of St. Mary of Andover to the abbey of
  St. Florence, at Salmur, in Anjou, in which there is the following
  recital:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Noscant qui sunt et qui futuri sunt, quod Willielmus</p>
      <p>rex, qui <i>armis Anglicam terram sibi subjugavit</i>,</p>
      <p>dedit." &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If this charter was granted by William I., under whom Dugdale has
  placed it in his <i>Chronica Series</i>, p. 1., <i>nomine Baldric</i>,
  the argument is so much the stronger; but I have endeavored to prove by
  internal evidence (<i>Judges of England</i>, vol. i. p. 67.) that it is a
  charter of William II.</p>

  <p class="author">EDWARD FOSS.</p>

  <p><i>Thruscross</i> (Vol. ii., p. 441.).&mdash;In a sermon preached at
  the funeral of Lady Margaret Mainard, at Little Easton, in Essex, June
  30, 1682, by Bishop Ken, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The silenced, and plundered, and persecuted clergy she thought worthy
  of double honour, did vow a certain sum yearly out of her income, which
  she laid aside, only to succour them. The congregations where she then
  communicated, were those of the Reverend and pious Dr. Thruscross and Dr.
  Mossom, both now in heaven, and that of the then Mr. Gunning, the now
  most worthy Bishop of Ely, for whom she ever after had a peculiar
  veneration."</p>

  <p>"My last son Izaak, borne the 7th of September, 1651, at halfe an
  houre after two o'clock in the afternoone, being Sunday, and he was
  baptized that evening by Mr. Thruscross, in my house in Clerkenwell. Mr.
  Henry Davison and my brother Beacham were his godfathers, and Mrs. Roe
  his godmother."&mdash;<i>Izaak Walton's Entry in his Prayer Book.</i></p>

  <p><i>Osnaburgh Bishopric</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 358. 447.).&mdash;The
  succession to this bishopric was regulated by the Treaty of Westphalia,
  in 1648. By virtue of that treaty the see of Osnaburgh is alternately
  possessed by a Romish and a Protestant prince; and when it comes to the
  turn of a Protestant, it is to be given to a younger son of the house of
  Hanover. The <i>Almanach de Gotha</i> will most probably supply the
  information who succeeded the late Duke of York. Looking at the names of
  the titular bishops of Osnaburgh, it may be inferred that the duties
  attached to the see are confined to its temporalities.</p>

  Langtoft. One of the Harmonies of the Life of Christ is in the British

  <p><i>Lady Jane of Westmoreland</i> (Vol. i., p. 103.).&mdash;I think
  your correspondent Q.D. is wrong in his supposition that the two

  Registers of the Stationers' Company</i> refer to a composition by Lady
  Jane of Westmoreland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"1585-6. Cold and uncoth blowes, of the Lady Jane of Westmorland.</p>

  <p>1586-7. A songe of Lady Jane of Westmorland."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My idea is, that the ballad (for Mr. Collier thinks that both entries
  relate to one production) was merely one of those metrical ditties sung
  about the streets of London depicting the woes and sufferings of some
  unfortunate lady. The question is, who was this "unfortunate lady?" She
  was the wife of Ralph, Earl of Westmoreland, who was attainted about the
  year 1570, and died in Flanders anno 1584. I learn this from a MS. of the
  period, now before me, entitled <i>Some Account of the Sufferinges of the
  Ladye Jane of Westmorlande, who dyed in Exile. By T.C.</i> Perhaps at
  some future time I may trouble your readers with an account of this

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p><i>The New Classical Dictionary of Biography, Mythology, and
  History</i>, may be considered as the third in that important series of
  Classical Dictionaries for which the world is indebted to the learning of
  Dr. Smith. As the present work is distinguished by the same excellencies
  which have won for the <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i>,
  and the <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, the
  widely-spread reputation they enjoy, we shall content ourselves with a
  few words explanatory of the arrangement of a work which, it requires no
  great gift of prophecy to foretell, must ere long push Lemprière from its
  stool. The present Dictionary may be divided into three portions. The
  Biographical, which includes all the historical names of importance which
  occur in the Greek and Roman writers, from the earliest times down to the
  extinction of the Western Empire; those of all Greek and Roman writers,
  whose works are either extant or known to have exercised an influence
  upon their respective literatures; and, lastly, those of all the more
  important artists of antiquity. In the Mythological division may be
  noticed first, the discrimination, hitherto not sufficiently attended to,
  between the Greek and Roman mythology, and which in this volume is shown
  by giving an account of the Greek divinities under their Greek names, and
  the Roman divinities under their Latin names; and, secondly, what is of
  still more consequence, the care to avoid as far as possible all
  indelicate allusions in the respective histories of such divinities.
  Lastly, in the Geographical portion of the work, and which will probably
  be found the most important one, very few omissions will be discovered of
  names occurring in the chief classical writers. This brief sketch of the
  contents of this <i>New Classical Dictionary</i> will satisfy our readers
  that Dr. Smith has produced a volume, not only of immense value to those
  who are entering upon their classical studies, but one which will be
  found a most useful handbook to the scholar and the more advanced
  student.</p>

  <p><i>The Greek Church, A Sketch</i>, is the last of the Shilling Series
  in which Mr. Appleyard has described <!-- Page 486 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>{486}</span> the
  different sections of Christendom, with a view to their ultimate reunion.
  Like its predecessors, the volume is amiable and interesting, but being
  historical rather than doctrinal, is scarcely calculated to give the
  uninformed reader a very precise view of the creed of the Greek Church.
  It may serve, however, to assure us that the acrimony of religious
  discussion and the mutual jealousy of Church and State, which disquiets
  so many minds at present, was more than matched in the days of
  Constantine and Athanasius.</p>

  <p>The last part of the <i>Transactions of the Academy of Sciences</i> of
  Berlin contains two papers by Jacob Grimm, which will doubtless be
  perused with great interest in this country. The one on the ancient
  practice of burning the bodies of the dead (<i>Ueber das Verbrennen der
  Leichen</i>) will be of especial interest to English antiquaries; but the
  other, from its connexion with the great educational questions which now
  occupy so much of public attention, will probably be yet more attractive.
  It is entitled, <i>Ueber Schüle Universität Academie</i>. Separate copies
  of these Essays may be procured from Messrs. Williams and Norgate.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson (Wellington Street, Strand) will sell on

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

  <p>JEEDEE. <i>Notwithstanding Dr. Parr's assertion to the contrary, the
  </i>MALLEUS MALEFICARUM<i> is by no means an uncommon book, as may be
  seen by a reference to Grüsse </i>(Bibliotheca Magica, p. 32.)<i>, where
  upwards of a dozen editions are enumerated, and a table of its contents
  may be seen. The work has been very fully analysed in the second volume
  of Horst's Dämonomagie, and, if we remember rightly, its history is told
  by Soldan in his </i>Gesch. der Hexenprocesse.</p>

  <p>R.H. (Trin. Coll. Dub.) <i>will see that it is impossible to adopt his
  kind suggestion without spoiling the uniformity of the work. We have a
  bound copy of our First Volume now before us, and can assure him that,
  although the margin is necessarily narrow the book has not been spoilt by
  the binder.</i></p>

  <p>J.S. Nortor <i>or </i>Nawter<i> is only the provincial mode of
  pronouncing </i>neatherd<i>. The </i>Nolt<i> market is the ancient name
  of a street in Newcastle&mdash;the cattle-market. See Brockett's
  </i>Gloss. of North Country Words<i>, s.v. </i>NOWT<i> or </i>NOLT.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Receipt <i>is used in the sense of </i>receptacle<i>; and (we quote
  from one of the commentators)</i>, "The <i>limbeck</i> is the vessel
  through which distilled liquors pass into the recipients. So shall it be
  with memory, through which every thing shall pass, and nothing
  remain."</p>

  <p>DJEDALEME TEBEYR. <i>Some of our correspondent's articles would, we
  have no doubt, have appeared ere this, but for the difficulty of

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
